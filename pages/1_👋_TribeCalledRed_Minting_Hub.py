    - This is an unofficial project for the Tribe Called Red, aka Halluci-Nation involving gamification of musical culture and retro game revival.
    - This project is also a freedom project under the auspices of the EMIT-FREEDOM act.  More information will be provided in the community Slack Chat - Link TBA.
    - We exist strictly to raise money for tribal concerns via crypto and musical fundraising and art economics in Games.
